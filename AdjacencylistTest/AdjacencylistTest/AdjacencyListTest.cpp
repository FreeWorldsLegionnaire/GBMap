//Let's try to see if we can #include the Boost library for the adjacency list in this .cpp file and save the modifications.
//We would then individually on our own computers download the Boost library and this .cpp file and see if we can print a simple Adjacencylist
//on all our VisualStudios

//So we should focus our efforts into making, instead a 10x10, a 2x2 Adjacencylist to keep things simple.

//We should deliberately try to modifiy this .cpp file to see if the changes are reflected in the entire branch.
